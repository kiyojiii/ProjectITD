    <p>Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth’s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives. Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.

    Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.
    The impacts of climate change are already destroying livelihoods and aggravating economic, political, social, and environmental inequality. Without urgent action, this could make it impossible for poor and marginalized people to reach a wide range of development and justice goals.</p>

		<p>Hello My Name is Clint Joshua O. Velasquez, I created this website to make an advocacy about Climate Change. Since Climate Change is the greatest challenge that we are facing today. If we don't handle it, it is really dangerous, so the effects are fatal. In addition, to behaviors that trigger it, we need to pay attention to some important things; strengthen our resistance to its effects; and speak about it.</p>
		<div class="sp" id="sp">
		<p2>Global warming is accelerating, and since 1995, all of the 20 warmest years on record have arrived. In addition, there were five warmest years during the last decade of 2010. Many animals, birds, ecosystems, plants, and marine life are seriously affected due to global warming. The hot conditions also increased water demand.

		It is a joke, to say, that there is nothing like climate change. A ton has also been done to counter it, too. But we're still not doing everything we can. Our top primary agenda should be tackling climate change. There is no key agenda since most people are concerned with their lives and have other worries. Furthermore, if words such as "global warming" and "climate change" have been a turn-off for average people, then these words should be altered. We can also use phrases such as an underwater universe, a mortgage future, etc.</p2>
